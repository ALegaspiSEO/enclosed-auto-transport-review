      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-4">What is Enclosed Auto Transport?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Enclosed auto transport involves shipping your vehicle in a fully enclosed trailer, providing complete protection from external elements like rain, snow, dust, and road debris. Unlike open transport, which exposes vehicles to the environment, enclosed transport is designed for high-value, luxury, classic, or exotic cars that require extra care.</p>
      <img src="https://example.com/enclosed-carrier.jpg" alt="Luxury car being loaded onto an enclosed trailer" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-md mb-4">
      <p class="mb-4">Key features of enclosed auto transport include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Complete Protection:</strong> Shields your vehicle from weather, debris, and potential damage, ensuring it arrives in pristine condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Enclosed trailers hide vehicles from public view, reducing the risk of theft or vandalism.</li>
        <li><strong>Customized Handling:</strong> Hydraulic lift systems ensure safe loading and unloading, especially for low-clearance vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Service:</strong> Often carries fewer vehicles (1-4) for faster, more direct delivery compared to open transport.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">Enclosed transport is ideal for long-distance hauls, harsh weather conditions, or vehicles that demand pristine condition upon arrival, such as collector cars or supercars. AmeriFreight’s expertise ensures that your vehicle receives the VIP treatment it deserves.</p>
